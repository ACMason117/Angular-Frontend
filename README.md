This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.4.

## Installation

#### Prep work

#### Setup and running
1. Clone the repo and put it next to the backend repo
2. Do `npm install`
3. Do `npm install --only=dev`
4. Run the frontend using `npm run start`
5. Navigate to [`http://localhost:80/`](http://localhost:80/)

Note: the application will automatically reload if any changes are made to the source files in the frontend.
if you change any of the source files.

## General intuition (for starting developers)
When starting out, don't worry about anything outside the `src/` folder. Until you are very familiar with the `src/` 
folder and have made some good pull requests, everything outside the `src/` folder is unimportant.

So what's in the `src/` folder?
